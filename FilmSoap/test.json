With Vernon Wells from Mad Max 2 and Commando."},{"id":10453,"title":"HARD MEN","year":1997,"director":"J.P.AMALOU","stars":"VINCENT REGAN, ROSS BOATMAN","review":"Heavy British crime film with the hard men of the title (Regan, Boatman and Lee Ross) being debt collectors, enforcers and, when necessary, executioners for a crime boss (the surprisingly good Mad Frankie Frazer). When Regan wants to leave the life of crime, the boss demands him offed. Very violent and  a constant stream of obscene language severely limits the audience for this."},{"id":10454,"title":"HARD TARGET","year":1993,"director":"JOHN WOO","stars":"JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME","review":"First American film from hot Hong Kong action director John Woo. Van Damme plays an unemployed man who infiltrates a secret society when investigating the death of a young womans brother.

A sculptress creates her work from salvaged metal and computer parts, only to find that she has assembled a killer military robot from spares. Lousy direction and poor performances dont help.  IPC Magazines successfully sued on charges of plagiarism after it was proved that the story was lifted from a comic strip called Shock which ran in a 2000 A.D. annual."},{"id":10457,"title":"HARLEM NIGHTS","year":1989,"director":"EDDIE MURPHY","stars":"EDDIE MURPHY, ARSENIO HALL","review":"Eddie spreads his talents thinly on both sides of the camera in this relentless foul-mouthed period comedy. Hes the owner of a Harlem nightclub during the early 30s, with irritating sidekick Arsenio Hall forever with him. When rival white gangster Michael Lerner (Barton Fink) tries to take over the club its turf war time.

SWEENEY","review":"Marlee Matlin from Children Of A Lesser God is the star in this average thriller. She plays a deaf girl terrorised by corrupt policeman Martin Sheen, believing she has a valuable coin hidden in her apartment. Very similar to the classic thriller Wait Until Dark which put a blind Audrey Hepburn in the same sort of danger."},{"id":10461,"title":"HEAT","year":1996,"director":"MICHAEL MANN","stars":"ROBERT DE NIRO, AL PACINO","review":"A brilliant, sprawling crime thriller with De Niro as the brains behind a gang of armed robbers and Pacino as the cop doggedly on his tail.

Winslet and Lynskey play alienated teenagers in the New Zealand of the mid-50s, becoming close through sharing a fantasy world. When one of their mothers threatens to move one of the girls away they devise a plan to stay together, even though it involves murder. Compelling and sometimes harrowing."},{"id":10465,"title":"HELLBOUND","year":1993,"director":"AARON NORRIS","stars":"CHUCK NORRIS, CHRISTOPHER NEAME","review":"A decidedly different spin for Chuck, he plays a cop on the trail of a serial killer.

Directed by Chucks brother, also responsible for Delta Force 2."},{"id":10466,"title":"HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER II","year":1988,"director":"TONY RANDEL","stars":"ASHLEY LAWRENCE, DOUG BRADLEY","review":"The Cenobites return for another go at Ashley Lawrence in this sequel to the Clive Barker original. Still after the mystical puzzle box, they interest a doctor (Kenneth Cranham) who has plans to join their depraved ranks. Confusing plot and occasionally wobbly effects."},{"id":10467,"title":"HELLRAISER","year":1987,"director":"CLIVE BARKER","stars":"ASHLEY LAWRENCE, CLARE HIGGINS","review":"The first of the franchise introducing the Cenobites, apostles of evil and worshippers of pain. When a couple move into a new home the wife manages to revive her dead ex, Frank. But if Frank is to become complete rather than just flesh and bone more people will have to die. Great atmospheric photography and costume design on an obviously limited budget. Sequels of varying success followed."},{"id":10468,"title":"HELLRAISER - BLOODLINE","year":1996,"director":"ALAN SMITHEE","stars":"DOUG BRADLEY, VALENTINA VARGAS","review":"Disappointing and confused closer to the series, here the Cenobites follow a family through generations, from a debauched French aristocrat who dabbled with evil through a modern day couple tangling with Pinhead and co., before an Aliens style finale aboard a space station. Pinhead, your time is up. The credit Alan Smithee hides directors Kevin Yeager and Joe Chappelle, who had their names taken off this."},{"id":10469,"title":"HELLRAISER III: HELL ON EARTH","year":1992,"director":"ANTHONY HICKOX","stars":"TERRY FARRELL, DOUG BRADLEY","review":"Probably the best of the lot, an imaginative and scary sequel with the Cenobites still trying to get possession of the devilish puzzle box. Doug Bradley returns as Pinhead with Terry Farrell from Deep Space Nine as the investigative reporter who gets involved. Director Hickox comes up with some really chilling stuff. This video version runs longer than the cinema print."},{"id":10470,"title":"HENRY - PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER","year":1989,"director":"JOHN MCNAUGHTON","stars":"MICHAEL ROOKER, TOM TOWLES","review":"Disturbing and often shocking film following the title character, a remorseless sociopath, shot in almost documentary style.

Definitely not for the nervous."},{"id":10471,"title":"HER MAJESTY MRS. BROWN","year":1997,"director":"JOHN MADDEN","stars":"JUDI DENCH, BILLY CONNOLLY","review":"Charming romantic whimsy based on a true story. After the death of her beloved Prince Albert, Queen Victoria went into a decline, becoming extremely depressed and withdrawn. It was John Brown, one of the groundsmen on her Scottish estates, who brought her back to health, mostly by treating her as an ordinary person and not a regal personage. Terrific performances from both Dench and Connolly add to the charm."},{"id":10472,"title":"HERCULES AND THE LOST KINGDOM","year":1993,"director":"HARLEY COKLISS","stars":"KEVIN SORBO, ANTHONY QUINN","review":"A compilation of episodes from the popular TV series. Kevin Sorbo flexes his muscles a lot as the heroic Hercules, off on a quest to find the lost city of Troy while all the time trying to avoid the wrath of his evil stepmother Hera.

Living through the centuries he finds that one of their number, a renegade called Kurgan, is killing all the other Immortals.

Bond is this time pitted against Hugo Drax (Lonsdale) in a re-run of the plot of You Only Live Twice. Drax is stealing space shuttles via an elaborate space station, and plans to wipe out the worlds population with nerve gas and replace them with his own genetically engineered perfect race.

GRANT, PAUL MC GANN","review":"Comedy which has developed a definite cult following over the years. The title characters are two poor, struggling actors in the 60s, lurching from one drunken or drug-fuelled revel to the next. Fancying a break they decide to stay at Withnails Uncle Montys cottage in the country, not expecting him to be there. But he is, and he rather fancies the titular I.

It  shows him in a more critical light than the more popular Tombstone, which was made at exactly the same time. Costner is at his best as Earp, with Dennis Quaid as the dying Doc Holliday.

Their trajectory tracks back to the area around a deserted dormant volcano, which SPECTRE have converted into a rocket launch pad. Donald Pleasance makes for a memorable, scarred Blofeld and the final storming of the volcano by ninjas is a thrilling set-piece. Nancy Sinatra sings the title song."},{"id":11310,"title":"ZANDALEE","year":1991,"director":"SAM PILLSBURY","stars":"NICOLAS CAGE, JUDGE REINHOLD","review":"Steamy triangular drama with Reinhold as a poet suffering from severe writers block, the result of which is a strained relationship with his sultry wife (Erika Anderson), not helped (as youd imagine) when childhood friend Cage comes to stay. Hes the untamed sort as opposed to Reinholds restrained character, and the two starts a tempestuous affair. The director went onto make Free Willy 3!"}]
